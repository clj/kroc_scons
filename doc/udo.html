    <H3>Abstract:</H3>

    <P>This document is intended as a supplement to the online
      occam2.1 extension documentation at
      <A NAME="tex2html1" HREF="#13">(1)</A> via the
      IPCA<A HREF="#IPCA">(2)</A>.  It describes the first in a
      series of new additions to the SGS-Thompson occam compiler.
      These extensions are only available as part of the KRoC
      compiler package, and not for the original toolset
      compiler.</P>


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">Introduction</A></H2>

    <P>This paper documents the extension to the <I>occam2.1</I>

    <P>This extension provides user-defined operators over any

    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">Syntax and semantics</A></H2>

    <P>The syntax for declaring a new operator is identical to a
      <TT>FUNCTION</TT> except that:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI> instead of a user-defined name, there is a user-defined string
	containing the sequences of characters making up the desired operator.
	Note that this sequence must be one of those listed in
	Figures 1 or 2 - we
	are not allowed to make up our own symbols.  Note also that since
	<TT>*</TT> is an escape character in <I>occam</I> strings, that
	operator has to be quoted as <TT>"**"</TT>.
	
      <LI> there must be either two arguments (for a <I>binary</I> operator)
	or one argument (for a <I>unary</I> operator).  Note that, as for
	<TT>FUNCTION</TT>s, these arguments must be <TT>VAL</TT> data
	types.  Henceforth, we shall use the term <I>operands</I> for these
	arguments.

      <LI> there may only be one return type (not a list) from these operators.

    </UL>

    <P>All the semantic rules for <TT>FUNCTION</TT>s are inherited
      for operators.  So, operator bodies may cause no side-effects,
      either through modifying global data-structures or through
      communication.  This is checked by the compiler.</P>

    <P>Operators may be <TT>INLINE</TT>d.  Their bodies may be
      <I>one-liners</I>, using the <TT>IS</TT> syntax for
      <TT>FUNCTION</TT>s, or they may be <TT>VALOF</TT>
      expressions.</P>

    <P>Operators may be defined for any <I>occam2.1</I> types,
      including array types.  The operand types (for <I>binary</I>
      operators) do not have to be the same.  Formal operand arrays
      may be <I>open</I> (i.e. unsized) or closed (i.e. sized).
      However, because of the normal rules for <I>occam</I>
      <TT>FUNCTION</TT>s, any array result type must be sized.</P>


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">A simple example</A></H2>

    <P>Suppose we define:</P>

    <PRE>
  DATA TYPE COMPLEX64 IS
    RECORD
      REAL64 real, imag:
  :
    </PRE>

    <PRE>
  COMPLEX64 INLINE FUNCTION "+" (VAL COMPLEX64 a, b) IS
    [a[real] + b[real], a[imag] + b[imag]]:
    </PRE>

    <P>We may then start using them like:</P>

    <PRE>
  COMPLEX64 a, b, c:
  SEQ
    a := [42.0, 99.7]
    b := [-123.456, 78.0]
    c := a + b
    ...  etc
    </PRE>


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">Operator resolution and overriding</A></H2>

    <P>When resolving which operator function is intended for any
      particular use of an operator symbol, only the operand types
      are used.  We considered making the result type significant,
      but that leads very quickly to nested expressions whose
      operators cannot be resolved (because they have equally valid
      alternative interpretations).</P>

    <P>So, operators may be uniquely overloaded up to the types of
      their operands.  However, this means that if we define the
      following two operators:</P>

    <PRE>
  THING FUNCTION "+" (VAL FOO a, VAL BAR b) IS ...

  THONG FUNCTION "+" (VAL FOO a, VAL BAR b) IS ...
    </PRE>

    <P>the later definition will <I>override</I> the first one.
      Thus, if <TT>x</TT> is of type <TT>FOO</TT> and <TT>y</TT> is
      of type <TT>BAR</TT>, the expression <TT>x + y</TT> will be
      evaluated using the later definition and will yield a value of
      type <TT>THONG</TT>.</P>

    <P>Note also that, because the compiler generates operator names
      made up from the operator symbol and its operand types, having
      the above two definitions compiled into some library (or even
      separate libraries) will cause a UNIX linking error.</P>

    <P>The current compiler is also blind to the <I>size</I> (or
      <I>un-size</I>) of operand arrays.  Thus, the following two
      definitions will suffer the same fate as the above:</P>

    <PRE>
  THING FUNCTION "[&gt;" (VAL [16]INT a, VAL [4]INT b) IS ...

  THONG FUNCTION "[&gt;" (VAL []INT a, b) IS ...
    </PRE>

    <P>However, note that <I>unary</I> operators cannot get
      overridden by <I>binary</I> operators.  So that the following
      two operators can be declared in any order and co-exist:</P>

    <PRE>
  COMPLEX64 INLINE FUNCTION "-" (VAL COMPLEX64 a) IS
    [-a[real], -a[imag]]:

  COMPLEX64 INLINE FUNCTION "-" (VAL COMPLEX64 a, b) IS
    [a[real] - b[real], a[imag] - b[imag]]:
    </PRE>

    <P>Generally, we deprecate the overriding of previously defined
      operators.  For example, a really twisted user may declare:</P>

    <PRE>
  INT INLINE FUNCTION "+" (VAL INT a, b) IS a - b:
    </PRE>

    <P>with somewhat opaque consequences for the remaining code!</P>


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">Unary and binary operators</A></H2>

    <P>The standard operators may only be overloaded provided their
      <I>binary-ness</I> or <I>unary-ness</I> is maintained.  Thus,
      <TT>+</TT> may only be used as a <I>binary</I> operator,
      <TT>NOT</TT> may only be used as a <I>unary</I> operator, but
      <TT>-</TT> may only be used as both.</P>

    <P>All the new operator symbols may be used for both
      <I>binary</I> and <I>unary</I> operators - for example:</P>

    <PRE>
  INT FUNCTION "$$" (VAL []INT a)  -- sum the array
    INT result:
    VALOF
      SEQ
        result := 0
        SEQ i = 0 FOR SIZE a
          result := result + a[i]
      RESULT result
  :
    </PRE>

    <P>And, then:</P>

    <PRE>
  [42]INT X, Y:
  [99]INT Z:
  SEQ
    ...  set up arrays X, Y, Z
    out.string ("The sum of X, Y and Z is ", 0, screen)
    out.number (($$ X) + (($$ Y) + ($$ Z)), 0, screen)
    out.string ("*n", 0, screen)
    </PRE>



    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">Operator inheritance</A></H2>

    <P><I>occam2.1</I> has a feature of inheriting the use of the
      standard operators on user-defined types that are defined
      directly in terms of the basic types.  For example, if we
      had:</P>

    <PRE>
  DATA TYPE BLUE.INT IS INT:
    </PRE>

    <P>then we could have:</P>

    <PRE>
  BLUE.INT a, b, c:
  SEQ
    ...  set up a and b
    c := a + b
    </PRE>

    <P>This was presumably done to allow operator usage over these
      types.  Whether this inheritance should be retained now that
      user-defined operators are available for such types is
      debatable.  [Note that <TT>INLINE</TT>d operators defining the
      standard arithmetic operators for <TT>BLUE.INT</TT>s (via casts
      into <TT>INT</TT>s) generates exactly the same code as direct
      use of the standard operators - there is no run-time overhead.]
      Anyway, this operator inheritance is preserved in the current
      <I>KRoC</I> 0.9beta release.</P>

    <P>However, there leads to an inconsistency.  If we were to define:</P>

    <PRE>
  DATA TYPE BLUE.COMPLEX64 IS COMPLEX64:
    </PRE>

    <P>where <TT>COMPLEX64</TT> is as defined earlier,
      <TT>BLUE.COMPLEX64</TT> does <I>not</I> inherit any
      user-defined operators for <TT>COMPLEX64</TT>.  Feedback on
      which way this incosistency should be resolved is welcome.</P>

    <P>The inheritance behaviour does raise a problem for types that
      are defined directly from the basic ones.  For instance, in the
      0.9beta release, we provide an example string library that
      manages dynamically allocated strings in the <I>C</I>-world.
      The <I>occam</I> type just holds a pointer to space in that
      <I>C</I>-world and the obvious type declaration is:</P>

    <PRE>
  DATA TYPE DSTRING IS INT:  -- dynamic string
    </PRE>

    <P>We can then define an <TT>++</TT> operator for concatenation
      and so on.  However, <TT>DSTRING</TT> automatically inherits
      all the standard arithmetic operaors on <TT>INT</TT>s which
      will enable arithmetic on pointers - <I>not</I> a good thing!
      To avoid this, we define <TT>DSTRING</TT> as a
      <TT>RECORD</TT>:</P>

    <PRE>
  DATA TYPE DSTRING          -- dynamic string
    RECORD
      INT pointer:
  :
    </PRE>

    <P>and the problem goes away.


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">Scope rules</A></H2>

    <P>The compiler follows the normal scoping rules as far as user
      defined operators are concerned - their scope is just like any
      other declaration.</P>


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00080000000000000000">Separate compilation</A></H2>

    <P>Operator definitions can be separately compiled and linked in
      the same way as <TT>FUNCTION</TT>s and <TT>PROC</TT>s.
      <TT>INLINE</TT>d operators, of course, cannot be separately
      compiled and we have to use the <TT>#INCLUDE</TT> mechanism,
      rather than <TT>#USE</TT>, for libraries that contain them.</P>


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00090000000000000000">Literal constants</A></H2>

    <P><I>occam2.1</I> untyped literals are resolved according to the
      data type to which they are being assigned (or passed).  For
      example:</P>

    <PRE>
  INT x:
  BYTE y:
  SEQ
    x := 6
    y := 6
    </PRE>

    <P>In the first case, the literal <TT>6</TT> is resolved to be of
      type <TT>INT</TT> and, in the second case, it is resolved as
      type <TT>BYTE</TT>.</P>

    <P>This presents a problem for user defined operators.  Given the
      code:</P>

    <PRE>
  INT FUNCTION "&amp;&amp;" (VAL INT x, y) IS x:
  INT FUNCTION "&amp;&amp;" (VAL BYTE x, y) IS INT y:
  INT z:
  SEQ
    z := 3 &amp;&amp; 4
    </PRE>

    <P>which version do we use?  The solution is to reduce untyped
      literals to a default state - but only when used within an
      operand for a user-defined operator (so as not to change the
      semantics of <I>occam2.1</I>).  The rules we have adopted are
      that undecorated literals, appearing in operand expressions for
      user-defined operators, are interpreted as follows:</P>

    <PRE>
      6  -&gt;  INT
    'b'  -&gt;  BYTE
    6.0  -&gt;  REAL32
    </PRE>

    <P>Thus, <TT>z</TT> will be assigned the value <TT>3</TT> in the
    above.</P>


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION000100000000000000000">Array and record constructors</A></H2>

    <P>There is a similar problem with array and record literals (or
      <I>constructors</I>).  In <I>occam2.1</I>, if the type of a
      constructor is not clear - the type of variable (or parameter)
      to which it is being assigned (or passed) is used to resolve
      the type.  For example:</P>

    <PRE>
  DATA TYPE BLUE.INT IS INT:
  [3]BLUE.INT a:
  a := [0, 1, 3]
    </PRE>

    <P>If the type of <TT>a</TT> had not been known, then the
      <TT>0</TT>, <TT>1</TT> and <TT>3</TT> could not have been
      resolved to <TT>BLUE.INT</TT>.  This resolution problem occurs
      normally in <I>occam2</I> when we have untyped abbreviations.
      For example:</P>

    <PRE>
  VAL a IS [1, 2, 3]:
    </PRE>

    <P>in which case, <TT>a</TT> is resolved to the type <TT>[3]INT</TT>.</P>

    <P>This resoution problem also occurs when using constructors
      with user defined operators.  For example, consider:</P>

    <PRE>
  DATA TYPE THING
    RECORD
      INT count:
      REAL32 value:
  :

  INT FUNCTION "^" (VAL THING x, y) IS x[count] + y[count]:

  INT result:
  result := [12, 1.2] ^ [1, 3.1]
    </PRE>

    <P>This will not compile because there is no way to determine the
      types of the two operands (the compiler could search all the
      definitions of user defined operators, searching for a match
      for the types, but this raises many other complicating issues).
      The solution is to decorate the record constructors with the
      typename - replacing the last line as follows solves the
      problem and will compile correctly:</P>

    <PRE>
  result := [12, 1.2](THING) ^ [1, 3.1](THING)
    </PRE>

    <P>If no type is specified then the compiler will try to resolve
      the constructor as an array.  It will first search the
      constructor for a known type and then attempt to make each
      other (possibly type not specified) elements in the array match
      this type.  If sucessful, the constructor gets typed as an
      array.  For example:</P>

    <PRE>
  INT FUNCTION "@" (VAL [6]BLUE.INT x) IS (INT x[0]):

  INT res:
  res := @ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5(BLUE.INT)]
    </PRE>

    <P>will resolve all elements in the constructor to type
      <TT>BLUE.INT</TT>, and then to <TT>[6]BLUE.INT</TT>.  If the
      last line had been:</P>

    <PRE>
  res := @ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    </PRE>

    <P>the constructor would have been resolved to <TT>[6]INT</TT>
      and no match for the <TT>@</TT> operator would have been
      found.</P>

    <P>There is one other slight modification - if a real literal is
      used as an operand to a user defined operator then it is
      resolved to <TT>REAL32</TT> - normal <I>occam</I> rules in this
      situation would throw it out without any decoration
      (e.g. <TT>3.2(REAL32)</TT>).</P>

    <P>Note that none of these new rules effect the normal rules of
      <I>occam2.1</I>.  Much care was taken not to damage the current
      type resolution system, so these new rules are only applicable
      when used with user defined operators.</P>


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION000110000000000000000">Example libraries</A></H2>

    <P>Some example libraries are included with the 0.9beta release -
      firstly a complex number library that supports the use of the
      standard operators on a complex type.  Please see the documents
      by David Wood on this and other similar libraries, including
      <TT>INT128</TT>s, <TT>REAL128</TT>s, <TT>REAL80</TT>s,
      <TT>REAL40</TT>s, sets, and a rational numbers library.</P>

    <P>There is also a new dynamic string library that actually
      allocates memory for strings in the <I>C</I> world, using
      <I>occam</I> types to hold pointers to them.  Strings can be
      created and deallocated (no automatic garbage collection is
      provided), converted to and from <I>occam</I> strings, and
      compared both for pointer equality (two variables of type
      STRING pointing at the same string), and textual equality (two
      strings textually equivalent).  All the other comparison
      operators are also available.  Concatenation of two strings is
      also supported using the new <TT>++</TT> operator.
      Documentation is included with the release.</P>


    <H2><A NAME="SECTION000120000000000000000">Using user defined operators in KRoC</A></H2>

    <P>By default user defined operators are disabled in the current
      release of <I>KRoC</I>, so a compiler flag must be set to
      enable their use:</P>

    <PRE>
  kroc -X2 prog.occ
