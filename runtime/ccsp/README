The CCSP run-time kernel has the following components:

  common/
    common files which can be shared by (hopefully) most CPU architectures.
    Things like the non-blocking keyboard input process and tty handling
    live here.

  arch/
    architecture-dependant base.

  arch/linux
    architecture files for the linux version of CCSP.  This includes things
    like the scheduler, CPU timers, blocking-syscalls, etc.

  include/
    common include files used by most bits of the distribution.  Also
    contains include files which application developers can link to in
    order to access CCSP run-time stuff.

  include/i386
    architecture dependant include files for the i386 CPU family.  This
    contains things like the vast amounts of scheduler assembler macros.

  include/mips
    architecture dependant include files for the MIPS family of processors.
    This is highly experimental.
