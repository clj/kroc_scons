Installation
============
After unpacking the package needs to be configured.  It uses GNU autoconf and 
automake.  To do this type:

  ./configure

this will build a system with all optional components enabled.  There are 
several options to allow selective features to be enabled and disabled.
The main options are listed by typeing:

  ./configure --help

when the system is configured type:

  make
 
or perhaps

  make install

to do the latter you will need write permission on /usr/local/lib, 
/usr/local/bin, and /usr/local/include.  This will also install the
demos in usr/loca/bin (which I should get round to chaning really). 
This (more importantly) should make [and install] all the libraries. 
The package produces three user visible libraries at present.  These will
probably combined into one at a later date: 

  libcrts.a - the kernel/run-time system.

  libcsp.a  - C support library.

  libexcomm.a - external communications.

They are separate because it is then possible to build systems to do the
following:

  purely support occam. (just libcrts.a)

  support csplib without external communications. (libcrts.a and libcsp.a)

  support csplib with external communications. (all three)

Distributions can be built with:

  make dist

The installations can be cleaned with:

  make clean

If working in individual directories 'make' should do all the necessary work.

PROBLEMS
--------
There may be problems building the files in crts/ (the UNIX interface).  In
this case try enabling some of the #ifdef'ed sections of code by #defining
the appropriate variable before the #ifdef.  If having real problems please 
contact ofa-bugs@ukc.ac.uk.
