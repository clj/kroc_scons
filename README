KRoC Linux -- Source Distribution
=================================


Installation
------------

To  install  the  source  distribution,  unpack  the  .tar
archive,  cd   to   the   directory   where   it  unpacked
(cd .../kroc/),  and run  the 'build' script.  The  script
will configure,  compile and setup  the KRoC distribution.
Calling the  script with the --help option will bring up a
list of available options.

In order  to compile  KRoC, you  will need  the relevant C
development  packages for  your  system.  In  Debian,  for
example, these are "libc6-dev" and "linux-kernel-headers".
You will also need the GNU C compiler (gcc).

It is possible to  install  the run-time  software  into a
directory other than where the sources are kept.  This can
be set using the '--install-dir <directory>' option to the
'build' script.  The first time the script is run, it will
prompt  for  this  (with  the  source-tree as  the default
installation directory).  To re-configure the KRoC install
use "./build --reconf".


Configuration
-------------

Before using  KRoC, remember  to source the relevant setup
file  (bin/setup.sh  for  sh/bash,  or  bin/setup.csh  for
csh/tcsh).  It may  be convenient to include this `source'
command  in the start-up  file for shell being used  (e.g.
~/.bash_profile,  ~/.cshrc),  or in the  system-wide shell
startup files (e.g.  /etc/profile  and  /etc/csh.cshrc  or
/etc/.login).

Problems / Bugs
---------------

Known bugs are given in the top-level BUGS file.  If the package
fails to  build,  mail  'F.R.M.Barnes@kent.ac.uk'  with a  brief
description of the  problem and a copy of the  'typescript' file
generated by 'build'.

Problems with  individual  occam programs should be  sent to the
relevant author (usually mentioned in the source code),  or more
generally to 'kroc-bugs@kent.ac.uk'.
