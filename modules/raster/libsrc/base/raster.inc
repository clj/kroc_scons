--** Basic raster graphics support.
-- This module provides basic data types for two-dimensional bitmap ("raster")
-- graphics.
-- To display graphics, you'll want to use a module like [@ref sdlraster].
--
-- @module raster

--* A bitmap image.
--
-- This is really a [@code MOBILE [][]INT], with the first dimension being the
-- Y coordinate and the second the X coordinate.
-- Each element represents an RGB-colourspace pixel in [@code #AARRGGBB]
-- format, with eight bits for each of red, green, blue and alpha. (Most things
-- ignore the alpha component.)
--
-- The pixel representation uses the native endianism, so if you retype it to
-- an array of [@code BYTE]s then the order of the components will vary between
-- platforms.
--
-- It's sometimes useful to have a sentinel value of this type (for example, to
-- use as a poison value in process networks); a zero-by-zero raster can be
-- used for this purpose ([@code MOBILE [0][0]INT]).
