--* Turn an occam array into an SDL surface.
-- This is a wrapper around [@ref SDL.CreateRGBSurfaceFrom].
--
-- @param pixels Array of pixels.
--   The first dimension is Y; the second is X.
--   Each [@code INT] is a single pixel in [@text #00RRGGBB] format.
-- @param surface The resulting surface.
--   This contains a pointer to [@code pixels], so you must free it with
--   [@ref SDL.FreeSurface] before whatever you passed as [@code pixels] goes
--   out of scope.
