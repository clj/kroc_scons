The SDL.i needs to be run with the -structpointers paramater for swig.

When checking for errors use occ_SDL_GetError instead of SDL_GetError as the 
latter will not work.

When loading textures and the like, you can use occ_get_SDL_Surface_pixels to get 
a copy of the pixels array which you can then pass to openGL (for example)

New versions of this wrapper and the swig occampi wrapper generator can be found at
http://swig.transterpreter.org
