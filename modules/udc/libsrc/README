channels (UDC) library, which currently contains the following
source files:

  udc_softchan.c

    implementation of the "softchan" simple channel

  udc_bufchan.c

    implementation of the "bufchan" buffered INT channel

  udc_sockchan.c

    implementation of the "sockchan" blocking socket channel

  udc_funcs.occ

    occam interface for creating and freeing the various
    channel types

  udc.inc

    UDC library include file.  This is currently empty, but
    will contain extra interface information in the future

  udc.lbb

    used by ilibr to build the occam library

  udc.h, spunixhdr.h

    symbolic links to header files in the CCSP source tree.
    These define the external functions avaliable in CCSP
    for handling user-defined channels, along with the
    ext_chan_t structure, which stores information about an
    external (user-defined) channel.
