User-defined channels example programs
--------------------------------------

This directory contains the following files:

  Makefile

    the makefile used to build the examples

  simple.occ

    example demonstrating the "softchan" user-defined channel

  buffered.occ

    example demonstrating the "bufchan" user-defined channel

  socktest.occ

    example demonstrating the "sockchan" user-defined channel.  This
    prompts the user for a hostname and port, then simply copies
    bytes between the channel and the socket.

  softalt.occ

    example demonstrating ALTing over channels, using "softchan"
    and "bufchan"

  softalt2.occ

    another ALT example, but where the ALTing process is forced to
    arrive second at the communication

  commstime.occ

    version of the commstime benchmark which uses "softchan" and
    "bufchan".  The user is prompted for which one to use, along
    with a buffer size.
