You will need your own copies of all the `.occ' files in this directory.

  bugs.occ

    This is a process with some serious syntactic and semantic damage.
    Your task is to get it to work as its designers intended!

  q1.occ

    Simple process communications: an out-of-phase producer/consumer system.

  q2.occ

    Use the `Legoland' processes to undo the integrate (i.e. differentiate).

  q3.occ

    Modify existing functionality by adding a parallel controller - not by
    modifying the existing component.

  q4.occ

    Create a test rig for the squares pipeline that shows all stages of
    processing.  Modify to allow user restting of its running components.

  q5.occ

    A type ahead buffer.

  q6.occ

    Names and numbers - an exercise using a variant PROTOCOL.  Solutions
    range from serial (with rich data structures) to highly parallel (with
    trivial data structures).  This uses the files `nn_data.txt',
    `nn_small.txt' and `nn_tiny.txt' for data.  It should generate results
    like those in `small_results.txt' or `small_results_sorted.txt'.

  q7.occ

    Animate the classic dining philosophers' college.
