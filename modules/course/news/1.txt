	CO502 : Parallel Computing and Formal Languages
	===============================================

The parallel computing element of this module will start in week 6.  These
lectures will take the Friday slot for this module -- i.e. the first
lecture will be on Friday, 19th. November, 1998, at 10:00am in GLT2.


Practical work for the Parllel Computing component of Co502:
------------------------------------------------------------

Practical work for this component will use UNIX.  Please make sure you have
your login on falcon (2nd. years) or gos (3rd. years).

Please make the following directory structures somewhere off your home
directory:

  occam/examples/
  occam/exercises/

From the directory containing the above directories, execute the following
commands:

  cp <wherever-is-installed>/kroc/examples/README occam/examples
  cp <wherever-is-installed>/kroc/examples/*.occ occam/examples
  cp <wherever-is-installed>/kroc/exercises/* occam/exercises

To make this easier, the file containing this posting is in:

  <wherever-is-installed>/kroc/news/1.txt

If you "more" its contents to the screen, you will be able to cut and paste
the above commands.

Next, take a look at -- but you do not need to copy:

  <wherever-is-installed>/kroc/README

and browse around the directories off <wherever-is-installed>/kroc/ ...
in particular, read all the README files ...

To pick up automatically the `kroc' utilities we shall be using to support
occam programming, please put the following line in your .cshrc file (in
your home directory):

  source <wherever-is-installed>/kroc/bin/setup.csh

**************************************************************************
*                                                                        *
*  ==> ==> Please do all of the above *before* your first class <== <==  *
*                                                                        *
**************************************************************************

But help will be available for this in your first class.

Good luck!


Course Notes for the Parllel Computing component of Co502:
----------------------------------------------------------

These will be available from Computing Reception -- I will post news when
they arrive.  The notes contain copies of the OHP slides I will be using
(4 per page) and supplementary papers:

  Title: NOTES.19
   Cost: 6 pounds

These notes will be all you need to follow this course -- apart from attending
the lectures and seminars (without which, the course notes will not be very
understandable).  You will not need to purchase a textbook.  However:

  <wherever-is-installed>/kroc/etc/reading.list

contains a (plain text) summary of the books available if you wanted to get
another point of view.
