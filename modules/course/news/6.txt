The directory:

  <wherever-is-installed>/kroc/course/answers

contains example solutions to the qeustions from the OCCAM EXERCISE SHEET.

Initially, only binary executables are accessible by you - e.g. q4 is the
executable compiled from the model answer to q4.occ.  So you can execute q4
to get a feel of how your own solution should behave.

In this directory, the solutions:

  bugs.occ
  q1.occ

have now been made readable by you.  Please check them out!
