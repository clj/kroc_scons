The following functions are added to the wrapper (and embedded in it)
so that occam can get the strings back directly, and not just the pointers
to the strings.
void occ_playerc_error_str(char err_str[], int len);
void occ_playerc_lookup_name(char err_str[], int len, int code);

I removed the following functions from the wrapper because it did not
wrap correctly.  Can look at this at some point later.

playerc_graphics2d_draw_polygon
playerc_graphics2d_setcolor
playerc_graphics2d_draw_polyline
playerc_graphics2d_draw_points

The error they generate looks like:
player_wrap.c: In function '_playerc_graphics2d_draw_polyline':
player_wrap.c:1707: error: conversion to non-scalar type requested

Furthermore, some additional functions had to be removed due to requireing
things that are named with _'s in the beginning.  occam-pi does not
like things which are called .something 

The following functions have been commented out:

playerc_mclient_addclient
playerc_client_adddevice
playerc_client_deldevice
playerc_client_addcallback
playerc_client_delcallback
playerc_client_request
playerc_client_write

Out of these, all but the first seem to be intended for internal use only.
I'm guessing it's a 'not clean' exposure of some internal functions.
The only one that would really be useful would be the first one,
playerc_mclient_addclient, if you wished to be connected to multiple
robots from one client program.

Furthermore the following functions are declared in the header file
but do not actually exist in the library:

playerc_simulation_set_property_int
playerc_simulation_set_property_double
playerc_simulation_set_property_string
