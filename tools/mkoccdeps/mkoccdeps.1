.SH NAME
mkoccdeps \- generates occam program dependency information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkoccdeps
[\fIoption\fR [\fI...\fR]] \fIfile\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Calculates dependencies for occam programs.  The programs scans the files given on the
command-line (as \fIfile\fR...) and produces Makefile compatible dependencies for them.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print usage summary and options
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version and exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
verbose operation
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR  \fIFILE\fR
output to \fIFILE\fR.  "-" means standard output, that is the default
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-follow\fR
follow referenced files and generate dependency information for those too
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-follow\-local\fR
follow referenced files, but only those in the current directory
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-allobjs\fR
additionally generate an ALLOBJS variable in the output containing all the object
files that have corresponding source files in the project
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-allotherobjs\fR
generate an ALLOBJS variable in the output contaning all the object files that
have corresponding source files, except those whose source file was given on the
command-line (only makes sense with the \fB\-\-follow\fR option).
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-include\fR  \fIPATH\fR
search \fIPATH\fR for occam libraries (sources) and includes
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
For a typical project, containing multiple source files and where "main.occ" has the
top-level process, depdencies suitable for a Makefile can be generated using:
.PP
	mkoccdeps -o DEPS -F -A main.occ
.PP
This will examine main.occ and any files it references, and so on.  An ALLOBJS variable
will be output that contains all the object files except "main.o".  This can be used
in conjunction with a Makefile rule of the form:
.PP
	main:    $(ALLOBJS) main.occ
.br
	         kroc main.occ $(ALLOBJS) $(LIBS)
.PP
.SH DEFICIENCIES
.PP
The program is blind to any conditional compilation (using the pre-processor)
